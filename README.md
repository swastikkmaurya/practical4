theory : Theory: Python Sets and Frozensets
In Python, a Set is a built-in data type used to store collections of data. It is defined by three primary characteristics:

Unordered: The items do not have a defined order; they may appear in a different order every time you use them and cannot be referred to by an index.

Unchangeable: While you cannot change the items once added, you can remove items and add new ones.

Unique: Sets do not allow duplicate values. If a duplicate is added, it is automatically ignored.
